## About

This repository serves as a collection of implementations of machine learning models from academic research papers. Each project includes:

- A detailed explanation of the model and its architecture
- The research paper it was derived from
- Instructions for training, testing, and using the model
- Results and benchmarks

We aim to provide not just working code, but also insights into the working principles of each model to foster learning and experimentation.
